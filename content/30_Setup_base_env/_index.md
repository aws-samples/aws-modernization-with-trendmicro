# Infrastructure Setup

## On-premises

As shown in the architecture diagram below, the first template will create an NFS server, an Application server, and a DataSync agent, and a File Gateway appliance will be deployed in an AWS region simulating the on-premises environment.


---

#### 1. Launch the CloudFormation template provided below to create our Mock On-Premises infrastructure in a new browser tab.

[![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=DataMigrationWorkshop-onPremResources&templateURL=https://aws-workshop-c1as-cft-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/on-premise-datamigration-workshop.yaml)

- This will automatically redirect to the AWS CloudFormation create stack page.
- Ensure AWS region is ```us-east-1```.
- Click **Next** on the Create Stack page.

#### 2. Specify stack details.
- Accept the default parameter values.
- Click **Next**.

---

#### 3. Configure stack options.
- Optional - Configure tags.
- Click **Next**.

---

#### 4. Review stack details.
- On the Review page, scroll to the bottom and **check the box** to acknowledge that CloudFormation will create IAM resources.
- Click **Create stack**.

Note: Instances that are launched as part of this CloudFormation template may be in the initializing state for few minutes.

While the CloudFormation deployment progresses in the on-premises region, you can proceed to deploy resources for the in-cloud region.

## Cloud Infrastructure

This template will be deployed in an alternative region. It will create an S3 bucket to simulate the AWS cloud region to which the NFS serverâ€™s data will be migrated.

---

#### 1. Launch the CloudFormation template provided below to create our Cloud Infrastructure..
[![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=DataMigrationWorkshop-inCloudResources&templateURL=https://aws-workshop-c1as-cft-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-datamigration-workshop.yaml)

- Ensure AWS region is ```us-east-2```
- Click **Next** on the Create Stack page.

#### Wait for the CloudFormation stacks in each region to reach the CREATE_COMPLETE state before proceeding to the next steps. 
It should take about 10 minutes for both CloudFormation stacks to complete.
